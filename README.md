# Google Data Analytics Capstone Project

This will be the final module of the Google Data Analytics Certificate, which requires the completion of a case study.
I have selected Track B: ‚ÄúChoose Your Own Questions and Dataset‚Äù for this project.

I have decided to conduct a trend analysis comparing pre-COVID and post-COVID tourism in Japan.
By collecting the relevant dataset and formulating my own questions as a proxy stakeholder.
It has greatly improved my understanding of the field of data analytics.

# Scenario
As a junior data analyst at Ring Travel Agency, a company based in Japan that offers private tour services within Tokyo and other prefectures across the country.

The company, specifically the marketing team, seeks to analyze the highs and lows of tourism before and after COVID-19 to determine which months or seasons to prioritize for marketing efforts,
 assess whether the tourism trend continues to rise, and identify which prefectures need additional tourism support.

The process for this case study will be structured according to the 6 key steps of data analysis outlined in the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate.
